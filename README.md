# SC-security
Code for remote authentication for a server client environment without verifier tables.
Implementation of my Paper titles "Design and Analysis of Smart Card based Authentication Scheme for Secure Transactions ", forthcoming article in Inderscience, http://www.inderscience.com/info/ingeneral/forthcoming.php?jcode=IJITST

The protocol uses no verifier table and authenticates users purely based on computations. The full details of the working of the scheme are highlighted in the paper.
