# SC-security
Code for remote authentication for a server client environment without verifier tables.
Implementation of my Paper titles "Design and Analysis of Smart Card based Authentication Scheme for Secure Transactions",  article can be found at Inderscience, https://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=95925 or email me for a copy.

The protocol uses no verifier table and authenticates users purely based on computations. The full details of the working of the scheme are highlighted in the paper.

The code was written long ago and naming conventions were not followed properly.
